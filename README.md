# Shopping-Application-CLI
This is a mini project which I made during my python ml course, to implement python foundational concepts.
This CLI based application contains to modules 1.) Admin and 2.) User
The admin part has various features as : add_product(), update_product(), remove_product(), view_product() from stock.
The user part has following features as : view_product(), addBasket(), viewBasket(), searchBasket(), removeBasket(), printInvoice().
Once the admin part is executed it's not accessible thereafter whereas user part can be executed again for same user or new user.
